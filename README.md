## Installation 
 If you fork/clone the repo, you can start the server with command "node server.js" and then navigate to localhost:8080 in your browser. This app is deployed on heroku at: [EAT THAT BURGER](https://floating-bayou-58848.herokuapp.com/)  
  
 
## Usage 
 This is not really a practical application to use as it is just practice using a database and updating the DOM with the db data.
  
 
## Credits 
 I repurposed another class exercise and swapped out variable names for this application. I also found and used the hamburger image here: https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/225103-realistic-fast-food
